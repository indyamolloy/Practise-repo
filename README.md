# Practise Repo
This repo has been made to document the new topics I'm learning and topics I'm reviewing again. 

### 1. Bootstrap 
Learnt the basics of bootstrap. I created a navabar to learn how to position elements and the grid layout system. 

I made a landing page for an app created during final projects. This can be viewed [here](https://tribeapp.netlify.app/).

While making this landing page, I learned how to use Bootstrap buttons, cards and a carousel.

### 2. jQuery 
In this folder I learned the basics of jQuery. I practised selecting and manipulating elements, removing and adding classes, adding event listeners and animations. 
I practised jQuery while making a memory game which can be played [here](https://remarkable-daifuku-9bb148.netlify.app/)!
